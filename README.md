# active-stabilization
This is the code for my active stabilization project. It was built in chunks; the gyro and accelerometer functions were created first, and the complementary filter and PID functions were built on top of them. Then they were successively assembled into the master program.

Most of the code in the master_program file is repeated in the individual sensor tests; the sensor tests are just included for reference.
